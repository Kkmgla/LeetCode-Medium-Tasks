## Detailed Explanation

When the robot starts its journey on an `m x n` grid, it must take:
- `m - 1` steps down
- `n - 1` steps to the right

Thus, the total number of steps the robot must take is `(m - 1) + (n - 1) = m + n - 2`.

To find the number of unique paths, we can use combinatorics. Imagine we have `m - 1` steps down and `n - 1` steps to the right to arrange in one sequence. This is equivalent to choosing `m - 1` steps down out of the total steps or, equivalently, choosing `n - 1` steps to the right.

To calculate the number of such combinations, we use the binomial coefficient \( C(k, r) \), which represents the number of ways to choose `r` elements from `k` elements:

In our case:

- k=m+n−2 (total number of steps)
- `r` is the number of steps down or to the right, whichever is smaller.

### Step-by-step Calculation

### Example

Let's consider a `3x7` grid:

- m = 3
- n = 7

**Total number of steps:**

**Minimum number of steps to choose:**

We will calculate \( C(8, 2) \), which means choosing 2 steps out of 8:

Therefore, the number of unique paths for a `3x7` grid is `28`.
